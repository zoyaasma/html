         Ooty is one of the most frequented holiday destinations for tourists from Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka. Given the fact that the southern part of India gets too hot during the summer season, a trip to Ooty offers the much-needed respite from the heat. This picturesque and serene hill station is also a popular honeymoon destination among couples. Ooty offers stunning views of the Nilgiri Hills and lush green landscapes dotted with alpine woods, clear lakes, emerald green tea estates, and colourful blossoms. The hill station also houses the popular Nilgiri Mountain Railway which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.

    <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
